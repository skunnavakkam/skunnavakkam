# My work / repos
I mostly do computational physics. I'm most interested in Intelligent Inverse Design, search in an infinite action space, and automatic proofs / theory building. I am hardly an expert. 

# About Me
I'm Sudarsh (he/him). I do Physics. I will be starting University @ TBD in the Fall of 2024.

# Contact
Please email me if you want to contact me. If you are interested in any repos, you should have low barrier to emailing me. I do check my Spam folder *fairly* often, and try to respond to everything, though I apologize if I miss your email.
